# KSL Castle Raids

## Briefing
Welcome folks to KSL catsle raids. You will be our main attack force to raid the enemy castles. You can read the detail rules below.

## Rules
Below is the 3 main attack plans, graded based on difficulty.
| Category | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `Easy` | `RaidTreasury.sol` |
| `Medium` | `RaidGemVault.sol` |
| `Hard` | `BanditFort.sol` |

### `RaidTreasury.sol`
For this attack plan, you need to formulate an attack angle for the smart contract and write your own attack script. If you can drain the entire balance of `GOLD` tokens inside the smart contract, you have successfully raided the enemy treasuries. Look carefully at the contract's code.


### `RaidGemVault.sol`
For this attack plan, you need to formulate an attack angle for the smart contract and write your own attack script. Most importantly, you need to unlock the vault. If you can drain the `GEM` NFT inside the smart contract, you have successfully raided the enemy vault.

### `BanditFort.sol`
For this attack plan, you need to formulate an attack angle for the smart contract and write your own attack script. If you can break the contract so that nobody else can be `banditLord`, you have successfully eliminated an enemy clan.

### `CastleMap.sol`
To make it easy to find, our scouts have reported back with a smart contract storing addresses of all the trasuries, vaults and forts.

### ABIs
Included in this attack kit, you can find the relevant ABIs to be used in your attack.

## Prizes
After completion, ask one of the Kaia team members at the KSL for your rewards.
